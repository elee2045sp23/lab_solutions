# Lab 1

## Accomplishments/Failures

All parts are completed as specified.  I wasn't sure what to output as far as precision was concerned, so I chose 2 digits after the decimal point.

## Reflection

1. Python and Matlab are almost identical for this type of program
2. It is helpful to make commits often so that my work can be document
3. README.md files are useful ways to document repositories as a whole
